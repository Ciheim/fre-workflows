# Usage

This tool is still in development. Follow the Usage Instructions to use it effectively. 

To use this tool, include the `EPMT_DATA_LINEAGE=1` flag in the `[[[environment]]]` configurations within the `[[root]]` section.

Due to the limitations of EPMT's annotation size, up to 1 subdirectory is currently supported, and larger workflows may exceed the annotation limit causing some tasks to be unrecorded.
